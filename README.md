## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales and profit data to uncover key business insights using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.
The goal was to perform exploratory analysis using pivot tables, and build an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.
This project covers the complete workflow from data preparation to visualization.

### Data Source
The dataset was downloaded from Google(publicly available data)
The raw data was initially unstructured and required cleaning and transformation.

### Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Excel- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
Power BI- Data visualization and dashboard creation

### Data Preparation (Excel)
The following steps were performed in Excel:
Converted data into table
created new calculated columns:
a)Profit Margin
b)Month
c)Year
Ensured data consistency and readiness for analysis

### Pivot Table Analysis (Excel)
Created the following pivot tables:  
Sales by Month  
Sales by Category  
Profit by Month  
Sales by Year  

### Key Insights from Analysis
Using the pivot tables, the following insights were identified:  
a)Sales by Region  
 Identified regions with the highest contribution to total sales  
 Highlighted regions with lowest sales performance  
 
b)Sales by Category  
 Determined the best-performing product categories  
 Identified categories with weak sales performance  

c)Sales by Month  
 Observed a seasonal sales pattern  
 Sales consistently peak toward the end of each year  
 A natural decline in sales occurs at the beginning of each new year  

d)Profit by Month  
 Found that high sales do not always result in high profit  
 Some months generated higher profit despite lower sales  
 Indicates the impact of costs, discounts, or pricing strategies  

c)Business Insights  
 Highlighted opportunities to improve profitability  
 Identified seasonal trends useful for planning marketing and inventory strategies  

### Data Visualization (Power BI) 
After completing the analysis in Excel, the data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.  

### Dashboard Components: 
a)Sales by Month (visual trend analysis)  
b)Sum of Profit by Month  
c)Total Profit (Combined KPI)  
d)Total Sales (Combined KPI)  
e)Line Chart: Sales Trend Across 4 Years  
 *Compares total sales across all four years  
 *Clearly shows which year performed best and by what margin  
 
### Key Outcomes
a)Built a complete analytics workflow from data to insights  
b)Gained hands-on experience with Excel pivot tables and Power BI dashboards  
c)Developed the ability to translate data into actionable business insights  

### Project Use Case
This project demonstrates:
a)Analytical thinking using pivot tables
b)Dashboard design and KPI reporting
c)Practical understanding of sales and profit analysis
